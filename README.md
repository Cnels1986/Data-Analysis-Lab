  Discover/Requirements:
  For this lab I am going to create a visualization of the popular of the different counties in PA, using the CSV file from the census website.

  Collection:
  Data got from the census website: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/counties-detail.html

  Data Prep/Cleaning:
  Looking through the CSV file, I've determined the two columns I will use are the: GEO.display-label (county names) and est72017sex0_age999 (newest record of population for both sexes).
